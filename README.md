This is a Website Design that I entered into competition at Cumberland Valley RSC 2023, winning fourth place. I'm hoping to place at International Student Convention this year, since I was just under the threshold last year. This website design is based off of 2022 design trends, and is optimized for mobile.

Main goals of the project:

* Have a good looking website with variety that supports all modern browsers
* Make the website engaging both visually and mentally
* Have logical connections between design elements
* Have variety in elements, but make sure the elements make sense for the use case
* Have good graphic design elements
