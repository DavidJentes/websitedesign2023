# David Jentes' Website Design
## Cumberland Valley Regional Student Convention 2023

This is a work-in-progress Website Design to be entered into competition at Cumberland Valley RSC 2023. I'm hoping to place at International Student Convention this year, since I was just under the threshold last year. This website design is going to be based off of 2022 design trends, and is going to be optimized for mobile.

Main goals of the project:

* Have a good looking website with variety that supports all modern browsers
* Make the website engaging both visually and mentally
* Have logical connections between design elements
* Have variety in elements, but make sure the elements make sense for the use case
* Have good graphic design elements
