		<h1>About Us</h1>
		<article>
			<p>The Cherub Foundation began in 2012 when Philip and Edith Cherub met a man who had been homeless for almost all his life. As they let him into their home, they realized it was God's calling for them to help others. They let many others into their home before purchasing land to build a new building to use as headquarters and a homeless shelter, and realized how much poverty affects people. As they let many more in, they hired more employees to handle cooking and more, and started an orphanage in a new building. They have also built up a large amount of money set aside to help people in debt, and also have developed a network of therapists across the country. If you need help, you can call The Cherub Foundation for help at any time at (800) 555-2368 and we can either help you directly or get you to someone else who can.</p>
			<p>We currently have two buildings in the United States, one serving as a homeless shelter and the other as an orphanage and food bank. There are currently plans to expand to other countries, however, we currently do not have the funds to do so. We would encourage donations or even just prayer. Donation instructions are on the home page if you are interested.</p>
